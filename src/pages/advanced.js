                    <h3>ESPALIER PRUNING</h3>
                    <p>
                      A technique where trees are trained to grow flat against a structure, such as a wall or trellis.
                      <br />
                      Steps:
                      <br />
                      1. Choose a central leader and establish horizontal branches at desired intervals.
                      <br />
                      2. Prune regularly to maintain the flat shape and remove any growth that extends outward.
                      <br />
                      Benefits: Saves space, improves sunlight exposure, and adds decorative appeal.

                    <h3>RENEWAL PRUNING</h3>
                    <p>
                      Focuses on removing old, non-productive wood to encourage new growth.
                      <br />
                      Steps:
                      <br />
                      1. Identify and remove 1-2 older, unproductive branches each year.
                      <br />
                      2. Ensure cuts are made close to the main trunk or a healthy lateral branch.
                      <br />
                      Benefits: Maintains a balance of young, vigorous growth and older, productive wood.

                    <h3>CANOPY MANAGEMENT</h3>
                    <p>
                      Techniques to control the density and spread of the tree canopy.
                      <br />
                      Steps:
                      <br />
                      1. Thin out crowded areas to improve light penetration and air circulation.
                      <br />
                      2. Maintain an open center or vase shape for optimal fruit development.
                      <br />
                      Benefits: Reduces disease risk, enhances fruit quality, and ensures uniform ripening.

                    <h3>FRUIT THINNING</h3>
                    <p>
                      The removal of some fruits early in the growing season to enhance the size and quality of the remaining fruits.
                      <br />
                      Steps:
                      <br />
                      1. Assess fruit set and remove excess fruits to maintain a balance.
                      <br />
                      2. Space remaining fruits about 6-8 inches apart.
                      <br />
                      Benefits: Prevents overburdening the tree, improves fruit size and quality, and reduces branch breakage.

                    <h3>RESTORATIVE PRUNING</h3>
                    <p>
                      Used for neglected or overgrown trees to bring them back to a productive state.
                      <br />
                      Steps:
                      <br />
                      1. Gradually remove large, old branches over several years.
                      <br />
                      2. Focus on restoring a balanced structure and removing excessive growth.
                      <br />
                      Benefits: Revitalizes old trees, improves light and air penetration, and restores productivity.
