                                       <p>The status of an orchard soils P supplying power can be difficult to determine, even with the best soil testing program. Fruit trees are deep rooted and can absorb P throughout a deeper soil profile than annual crops. Therefore they are using soil P that isn’t identified by normal soil sampling. Apple trees also absorb P over a long portion of the year, and most soil test calibration assumes a somewhat shorter uptake period. Of course other soil factors such as pH, temperature, moisture, compaction, etc. (at all rooting depths) also affect P uptake. With all of these complications, it may seem futile to take a soil sample, however it remains a fact that a healthy tree will take up more P from a high testing soil than a low one, so periodic soil testing is still a recommended practice. These Complications with trees illustrate the need for annual leaf analysis, coupled with the ability to apply needed nutrients by foliar, or fertigation methods.</p>

                                       <p>Sulfur is not often a concern with apples. The most likely exception would be on light colored or sandy soils. Plants take up only the sulfate (SO) form of sulfur. Applications of this form will be immediately available. Elemental sulfur (S) requires bacterial conversion to the sulfate form to become available. This process can take an entire season. Where leaf symptoms or plant analysis confirms the need, soil applications of 30 lb. S/acre (as SO) will correct most problems.</p>

                                       <p>Magnesium deficiencies in pome fruit are often diagnosed by mean of physical symptoms, a technically utilize foliar analysis. Usually when a deficiency, become visible the tree has already lost growth or yield because it has been deficient some period of time. Visual symptoms usually appears in a older leaves which develops light green blotches between veins often extending to leaves margin These areas turns fawn colour and then dark affected leaves may shed pre-maturely.
                                        Magnesium is one of the essential secondary micro nutrients. It occupies a central position in chlorophyll and therefore plays a important role in photosynthesis process.</p>

                                       <p>Apples leaf analysis frequently shows a need for higher Ca levels. Low Ca in the fruit cause several disorders, the major ones being bitter pit, cork spot, and senescent breakdown during storage. Apples are not efficient at obtaining calcium from the soil, and are not especially efficient at trans-locating Ca from the roots to the leaves and fruit. Also, during drought stress, water containing calcium may be trans-located from the fruit back into the leaves, thus reducing the Ca content of the fruit. Because of this, foliar sprays, spraying the fruit directly, and apple dips are commonly used to increase the Ca content of the fruit. Soil applications to crops with identified low leaf or fruit Ca levels do not have a Strong success record, however growers should take the necessary actions to correct soil Ca deficiencies, and add lime to acid soils, because this also affects other aspects of proper crop nutrition and growth. Foliar Ca applications, while effective, are not a substitute for keeping the soil properly limed.</p>

                                       <p>Boron plays a significant role in pollination success and it plays a role in the trees ability to tarns-locate Ca from the roots to other parts of the tree. It is highly mobile in the soil and supplied primarily by organic matter, so deficiencies are most likely to occur on light colored, coarse textured soils. Deficiencies can contribute to poor fruit set. Boron may be applied to the soil or the foliage with good effect. A complete boron program frequently includes both a soil application to meet the basic need of the crop, plus one or more foliar applications to supply additional boron at critical stages of crop development. Growers and their advisors should be aware that excessive B applications have the potential for direct toxicity to the crop. One sign that B uptake is excessive, is premature fruit maturity, and early fruit drop</p>
